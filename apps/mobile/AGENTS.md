# Overview

Clawket is a mobile client for OpenClaw (iOS/Android, React Native + Expo) inside the Clawket monorepo.

For OpenClaw protocol details and reference implementations, see: `../../../../openclaw` or `/Users/lucy/Desktop/op/openclaw`

If the task involves Android development or building an Android release package, refer to `docs/android-build.md`.
If the task is to prepare a fresh machine for Android packaging, read `docs/android-onboarding.md` first.

# Android Packaging Notes

When touching Android release packaging, keep these rules in mind:

1. Use `npm run build:android:aab` as the default Google Play packaging command.
2. That script is responsible for:
   - building Office packaged assets
   - syncing Expo native Android config through `expo prebuild`
   - producing the signed release `.aab`
3. Store-ready Android builds depend on local files and secrets that are not committed:
   - `apps/mobile/.env.local`
   - `apps/mobile/android/app/keystore.properties` or `CLAWKET_ANDROID_KEY_*`
   - the upload keystore file
4. `EXPO_ANDROID_VERSION_CODE` can override the Play version code when needed.
5. If no explicit Android version code is provided, `build:android:aab` auto-increments from the current native project state so repeat uploads do not stay stuck on an old value.
6. On macOS, prefer Homebrew `openjdk@17` at `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home` for Android builds to avoid the Gradle `IBM_SEMERU` issue.
7. `npm run build:android:pro-temp` is only for local Pro UI verification and must not be treated as a real subscription or Play-delivered validation flow.

# Clawket Ecosystem — Cross-Repository Awareness

Clawket now lives in a monorepo. This app is the client-facing frontend; relay and bridge live in sibling workspace folders.

## Sister Repositories

| Repo | Path | Role |
|------|------|------|
| **mobile** (this app) | `.` | React Native mobile app — Chat UI, Console, Config, Office game |
| **relay** | `../relay-registry`, `../relay-worker`, `../../packages/relay-shared` | Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects — WebSocket relay, registry, pairing |
| **bridge** | `../bridge-cli`, `../../packages/bridge-core`, `../../packages/bridge-runtime` | Node.js CLI + npm package — local bridge between relay and OpenClaw Gateway |

## Architecture Flow

```
[Clawket App] ←WS→ [Relay] ←WS→ [Bridge CLI] ←WS→ [OpenClaw Gateway]
```

## When to Look at Sister Repos

You **must** read the sister repo's code (start with its `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`) when:

1. **Connection issues** — If the bug involves WebSocket connectivity, handshake failures, "challenge timed out", or reconnection, the cause may be in relay or bridge, not in this app.
2. **Pairing flow** — QR code generation, `accessCode` claiming, token verification spans all three repos.
3. **Message protocol** — The WS frame format, control frames (`__clawket_relay_control__:` prefix), and `connect`/`challenge` handshake are defined in relay and bridge.
4. **Relay behavior** — Offline message caching, gateway owner lease, heartbeat/alarm logic live in `clawket-relay`.
5. **Bridge lifecycle** — Demand-driven gateway connection, lazy connect/disconnect, service install/uninstall live in `clawket-bridge`.
6. **Gateway API** — The app calls Gateway methods (`chat.*`, `config.*`, `models.*`, `cron.*`, etc.) through the relay+bridge tunnel. Understanding what the Gateway supports requires checking OpenClaw source at `../../../../openclaw` or `/Users/lucy/Desktop/op/openclaw`.

## How to Read Sister Repos

1. **Always read `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` first** — they contain architecture, rules, and pitfalls.
2. Then look at the specific code relevant to your task.
3. Do not modify sister repos without understanding their conventions.

## Language Policy
- All code comments and commit messages **must be in English**.
- No Chinese (or other non-English) text in source files — translations belong exclusively in locale files (`src/i18n/locales/` and `office-game/src/locales/`).

## Gateway Config Safety
- Any flow that patches Gateway config must show a secondary confirmation dialog, because the change will restart Gateway and may interrupt active OpenClaw tasks.

## Global Loading Overlay Rules
- Reuse the shared global loading overlay for app-wide in-flight states that should float above the current screen without replacing its layout.
- Preferred API: `src/contexts/GlobalLoadingOverlayContext.tsx` via `useGlobalLoadingOverlay()` and the root-rendered `GlobalLoadingOverlay`.
- The older Gateway-named exports (`useGatewayOverlay`, `GatewayOverlayProvider`, `GatewaySwitchOverlay`) are compatibility aliases only. Do not introduce new feature work against the Gateway-specific names unless you are touching legacy code that already uses them.
- Do not replace a whole screen with `LoadingState` when the intended UX is a transient global spinner above the existing UI. Use `LoadingState` for true full-screen loading pages only.
- If an in-flight action can be interrupted by dismissing a modal screen or swiping down a native-stack modal, add an explicit confirmation before leaving; do not assume the global overlay itself prevents dismissal.

## Release Update Modal
- The Chat first-screen release/update modal content lives in `src/features/app-updates/currentAnnouncement.ts`.
- When the user asks to change update-popup copy, CTA labels, target version, or destination, edit that file first instead of searching across Chat screen files.
- Any new user-facing strings introduced there must also be added to all 6 React Native locale files under `src/i18n/locales/{en,zh-Hans,ja,ko,de,es}/chat.json`.
- The display/cache logic for that modal is implemented in `src/services/app-update-announcement.ts`; UI lives in `src/screens/ChatScreen/components/AppUpdateAnnouncementModal.tsx`.

# Internationalization (i18n) Rules

## Supported Locales

| Locale | Code | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| English | `en` | Default / fallback |
| Simplified Chinese | `zh-Hans` | Full coverage |
| Japanese | `ja` | Full coverage |
| Korean | `ko` | Full coverage |
| German | `de` | Full coverage |
| Spanish | `es` | Full coverage |

## Two-Runtime Architecture

| Runtime | Tech | Translation source |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| React Native | i18next + `react-i18next` | `src/i18n/locales/{locale}/{namespace}.json` (4 namespaces: `common`, `chat`, `config`, `console`) |
| Office WebView | Custom `office-game/src/i18n.ts` | `office-game/src/locales/{zh-Hans,ja,ko,de,es}.ts`; locale set via `LOCALE` bridge message from RN |

## Key Design
- Use natural English text as translation keys: `t('Save')`, `t('Loading...')`.
- Missing translations fall back to the key itself (readable English).

## Required Rules
1. **All new features must include i18n for every supported locale.** No feature is complete until translations exist for **all 6 locales**.
2. **Hardcoded user-facing strings are forbidden.** Every visible string in RN screens must go through `t()`. Every visible string in Office game must go through the Office `t()`.
3. When adding a new RN translation key, add it to **all 6 locale directories**: `en`, `zh-Hans`, `ja`, `ko`, `de`, `es`. Never add a key to only one or two locales.
4. When adding a new Office game string, add translations to **all 5 non-English locale files**: `zh-Hans.ts`, `ja.ts`, `ko.ts`, `de.ts`, `es.ts`.
5. Translation keys must always be **natural English text** (e.g. `t('Save')`, `t('Loading...')`). Never use non-English text as keys.
5. Constants with translatable labels (e.g. tab arrays, picker options) must use `useMemo` + `t()` inside the component so translations update with locale changes.
6. `Alert.alert()` title, message, and button labels must be wrapped with `t()`.

## Forbidden Patterns
1. Do not hardcode UI strings in screen/component/office source files.
2. Do not use Chinese text directly in source code — only in locale JSON files and `zh-Hans.ts`.
3. Do not apply `t()` at module-level definition time for Office templates — apply at selection/render time (locale may change after init).

## How to Add Strings — React Native
1. Add key to **all 6** locale JSON files under `src/i18n/locales/{en,zh-Hans,ja,ko,de,es}/{namespace}.json`.
2. The `en` value should equal the key (natural English). Other locales provide the translated value.
3. Use `const { t } = useTranslation('{namespace}')` in the component.
4. Render with `t('Your new string')`.

## How to Add Strings — Office Game
1. Use `t('Your new string')` in the office source file (import from `./i18n`).
2. English works by fallback (key = English text).
3. Add translations to **all 5** non-English locale files: `office-game/src/locales/{zh-Hans,ja,ko,de,es}.ts`.

## Locale Delivery to Office WebView
- `src/screens/OfficeScreen/OfficeTab.tsx` sends `{ type: 'LOCALE', locale }` on WebView load and on `i18next.languageChanged`.
- `office-game/src/bridge.ts` handles `LOCALE` messages and calls `setLocale()`.

## Validation Checklist
1. All 6 locale JSON files (`en`, `zh-Hans`, `ja`, `ko`, `de`, `es`) have the same set of keys (no orphans).
2. All 5 Office game locale files have the same set of keys as `zh-Hans.ts`.
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
4. `cd office-game && npm run build` passes.

# Analytics Rules

Clawket uses PostHog for product analytics. Analytics work must stay centralized and low-noise.

## Required Rules
1. **Any new critical feature must include analytics.** This is mandatory for subscription/paywall/purchase flows and for core product actions such as connect, send, create, save, and major Console entry points.
2. **Do not scatter raw `posthog.capture(...)` calls across the app.** Add or reuse semantic helpers in `src/services/analytics/events.ts`, and keep client/config wiring inside `src/services/analytics/` plus the existing root hooks.
3. **Prefer business events over UI-noise events.** Track outcome-oriented actions (`gateway_connect_saved`, `paywall_subscribe_tapped`) instead of every close button, minor filter toggle, or transient interaction.
4. **Keep event properties compact and stable.** Prefer booleans, small enums, counts, and source labels; avoid high-cardinality raw IDs, large text, message contents, tokens, URLs with secrets, or other sensitive data.

## Notes
1. Page exposure is handled centrally from the navigation root; new navigable screens should be added to `src/utils/posthog-navigation.ts`.
2. When adding subscription or payment-related UI, update analytics in the same change. The feature is not complete until the critical paywall/purchase events are covered.

# Mobile Environment Variable Rules

Use a single documented flow for all mobile env changes. Do not invent one-off release steps.

## Required Rules
1. Add every new mobile env variable to `apps/mobile/.env.example` with a safe placeholder or empty default.
2. If the variable is used by client-side React Native code, name it with the `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` prefix.
3. Read mobile runtime config through `src/config/public.ts` or another shared config module. Do not scatter new `process.env.*` access through screens, hooks, or components.
4. If the variable enables or configures analytics, billing, support links, legal links, docs links, or release endpoints, update `scripts/check-public-config.mjs` so the release checks stay authoritative.
5. If the variable affects iOS release behavior, verify it works through direct Xcode `Build` / `Archive` by keeping it in `.env.local`. `ios/.xcode.env` already sources `.env` and `.env.local`; do not add a separate sync script unless the build system changes.
6. If the variable becomes required for a shipping flow, update `docs/ios-app-store-release.md` in the same change.

## Standard Change Checklist
1. Add the new key to `apps/mobile/.env.example`.
2. Wire it into `src/config/public.ts` or the appropriate shared config module.
3. Update `scripts/check-public-config.mjs` if release validation should enforce it.
4. Update the relevant docs.
5. Run `npm run config:check:ios`.
6. Run the affected tests and `npm run typecheck`.

# Chat Runtime Rules (RN Only)

All Chat feature work now targets a single runtime:
1. React Native chat (`FlashList` path).

## Responsibilities
1. Keep chat rendering, interaction, and modal behavior fully in React Native components.
2. Keep one data source in RN (`useChatController`) and avoid introducing parallel rendering pipelines.
3. Prefer extracting reusable RN components/hooks over adding runtime-specific branches.

## Common Pitfalls
1. Re-introducing a second chat runtime or runtime-toggle code path.
2. Splitting message rendering behavior across multiple disconnected data flows.
3. Re-adding gateway event subscriptions in view components that should stay presentation-focused.
4. Letting multiple chat run-recovery paths independently fire `chat.history` probes for the same session. Foreground recovery, reconnect recovery, watchdog probes, tool-result reloads, and final reconciliation must share single-flight coordination or they can multiply one active run into hot-room traffic bursts.

## RN Chat Maintainability
1. Keep `useChatController` focused on orchestration; move domain-specific state machines to dedicated hooks.
2. Prefer extracting reusable hooks for complex subdomains (for example voice input, model/command pickers, viewport, message selection).
3. Preserve `useChatController` return-shape contract during refactors, and validate with focused hook tests plus full test runs.

# Clawket UI Theming Rules

## Scope
This project uses a centralized light/dark theming architecture.
All new UI work must follow these rules so dark mode works automatically.

## Source of Truth
- Theme provider: `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- Theme tokens: `src/theme/theme.ts`
- Theme mode storage: `src/services/storage.ts`

## Required Rules
1. Use `useAppTheme()` in UI components that need colors.
2. Read colors only from `theme.colors`.
3. Build styles with a factory pattern:
   - `const styles = useMemo(() => createStyles(theme.colors), [theme]);`
4. For text inputs, use themed placeholder colors (`placeholderTextColor={theme.colors.textSubtle}`).
5. For markdown or rich content, generate themed style objects from `theme.colors`.

## Forbidden Patterns
1. Do not hardcode hex/rgb/rgba colors inside screen/component files.
2. Do not define local color palettes in business UI files.
3. Do not branch on dark/light manually in multiple places when a token can represent the intent.

## How To Add New Colors
1. Add semantic token(s) to both light and dark palettes in `src/theme/theme.ts`.
2. Name tokens by intent, not literal color (example: `surfaceElevated`, `textMuted`).
3. Consume the new token via `theme.colors.<token>` in components.

## Validation Checklist (PR Self-Check)
1. `Follow System` mode: switching OS light/dark updates UI correctly.
2. Manual `Light` mode renders correctly.
3. Manual `Dark` mode renders correctly.
4. Chat and Config tabs keep consistent theme when switching tabs.
5. Status bar style matches background contrast.
6. Run typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit`.

## Notes
- The architecture supports extension (e.g. high-contrast theme), but only if new UI uses semantic tokens.
- If a component needs a one-off visual state, add a token instead of hardcoding a color.

# Small Button Component Rules

When implementing compact icon-only buttons, always use shared UI components from `src/components/ui`.

## Required Rules
1. Use `IconButton` for bare icon actions (header/toolbar/inline utility actions).
2. Use `CircleButton` only for primary circular actions (send, scroll-to-bottom, FAB-like actions).
3. Use Lucide icons only for button icons; do not use unicode symbol text such as `✕`, `←`, `↑`, `+`.
4. Keep touch target size at least 44 for standalone actions; 36-40 is allowed for tightly grouped inline actions.
5. Prefer `strokeWidth={2}` by default; use `2.5` only for emphasized actions.

# Full-Width Button Rules

Full-width buttons are page-level actions that span the available content width (e.g. Save & Connect, Scan QR Code, Reset Device).

## Standard Spec

| Property | Value | Token |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `paddingVertical` | 11 | — |
| `borderRadius` | 12 | `Radius.md` |
| `fontSize` | 15 | `FontSize.base` |
| `fontWeight` | 600 | `FontWeight.semibold` |
| Inline icon size | 15 | — |
| Inline icon `strokeWidth` | 2 | — |

## Variants

| Variant | Background | Border | Text color |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|
| Primary | `colors.primary` | none | `colors.primaryText` |
| Outline | `colors.surface` | `1px colors.primary` | `colors.primary` |
| Destructive | `colors.surface` | `1px colors.error` | `colors.error` |

## Required Rules
1. All full-width buttons must use `paddingVertical: 11` and `borderRadius: Radius.md` — never deviate for visual parity.
2. Text must be `FontSize.base` + `FontWeight.semibold` — do not use `bold` or a different size.
3. Pressed state: Primary → `opacity: 0.88`; Outline/Destructive → `backgroundColor: colors.surfaceMuted`.
4. Buttons with an icon: use `flexDirection: 'row'`, `alignItems: 'center'`, `gap: Space.sm`, icon size 15, `strokeWidth={2}`.

# Top Navigation Bar Rules

All page-level top navigation bars must follow the same visual system as Chat header.

## Required Rules
1. Use a consistent header container style:
   - `paddingHorizontal: 4`
   - `paddingBottom: 2`
   - Push/back headers use the safe-area inset directly (`insets.top` or `topInset`) with no extra offset.
   - Modal/close headers use compact top padding; prefer `ModalScreenLayout` or `ScreenHeader` with `dismissStyle="close"` for content headers.
2. Use `IconButton` + Lucide for header icon actions (back/menu/refresh/add/edit/delete/play).
   - When the action is rendered inside a header slot, prefer `HeaderActionButton`.
   - For text-only header actions such as `Save`, `Done`, or `Edit`, use `HeaderTextAction`.
3. Header icon color must be `theme.colors.textMuted` for visual consistency across pages.
4. Keep header title style consistent: centered, `fontSize: 16`, `fontWeight: '600'`, `color: theme.colors.text`.
5. Keep left/right action slot widths symmetric (typically `44`) so title alignment is stable.
6. Avoid page-specific accent colors for header icons; only use disabled state colors (for example `theme.colors.textSubtle`) when interaction is unavailable.

## Native Modal Header Rules
1. Standard modal list/detail/display pages should use `useNativeStackModalHeader()` instead of rendering a page-level `ScreenHeader` inside content.
2. Use `HeaderActionButton` for native-stack header actions; do not hand-roll `IconButton` + themed Lucide icon in each screen.
3. Reserve native-stack modal headers for standard pages with simple title + close + 0-2 actions.
4. Keep custom in-content `ScreenHeader` only for pages that need richer layout, embedded tabs above the content, or page-specific visual structure that native-stack headers cannot express cleanly.
5. When a screen moves to `useNativeStackModalHeader()`, the first content section must still keep a deliberate top gap (`Space.sm` or `Space.md`) so cards/lists do not visually stick to the navigation bar.

## Custom Header Rules
1. Use `ScreenHeader` for non-native page headers only when the page needs content-owned chrome, such as embedded segmented tabs, complex multi-action toolbars, or layouts reused both as standalone pages and embedded sections.
2. Custom `ScreenHeader` pages must keep the same visual contract as native modal headers:
   - centered title
   - symmetric `44` left/right slots
   - `theme.colors.surface` background
   - `theme.colors.textMuted` icon color
3. Use `HeaderActionButton` for icon actions inside `ScreenHeader.rightContent`.
4. Use text actions in the header sparingly. Prefer a single semibold action label; keep it short (`Save`, `Edit`, `Done`) and render it with `HeaderTextAction`.
5. After a custom `ScreenHeader`, content should start with a deliberate section rhythm:
   - list/filter surfaces: `Space.sm`
   - card/form/detail content: `Space.md` to `Space.lg`
6. If a page currently renders `ScreenHeader` only for back/close + one simple action, prefer migrating it to `useNativeStackModalHeader()` instead of adding more custom header code.

## First-Screen Rhythm Rules
1. Use shared helpers from `src/components/ui/screenLayout.ts` for page content spacing instead of hand-tuning one-off `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom` values in each screen.
2. Standard list/detail pages should start from these defaults:
   - list content: `createListContentStyle()`
   - card/detail scroll content: `createCardContentStyle()`
   - list header/banner spacing: `createListHeaderSpacing()`
3. For list screens with empty states, prefer `grow: true` content containers so `EmptyState` stays vertically balanced.
4. Search bars, filter chips, and top summary banners should align to the same first-section offset as the list content below them; do not create a separate larger top rhythm unless the page is intentionally hero-led.
5. Empty states should feel centered within the content region, not glued to the header and not pushed too far down the screen.

# Componentization & Logic Split Rules

## Screen Layer Responsibilities
1. `src/screens/*` only orchestrates page-level state and wiring (navigation, gateway lifecycle, high-level composition).
2. For complex pages, prefer screen-as-folder layout: `src/screens/FeatureScreen/index.tsx + use*.ts + *Layout.tsx`.
3. Avoid putting large render blocks directly in screen files; move stable UI sections to `src/components/**`.
4. Avoid putting parsing/normalization/business transformations in screens; move them to `src/utils/**`.

## Hook vs Utils Boundaries
1. Put React stateful, side-effectful reusable logic in `src/hooks/**` (examples: picker state, modal interaction state, form state).
2. Put pure deterministic functions in `src/utils/**` (examples: message parsing, payload shaping, label formatting).
3. Hooks should return explicit action methods (`save`, `reset`, `pickImage`) instead of exposing scattered internal state updates.

## Component Granularity (Do / Don't)
1. Do extract by semantic section (Header, Composer, Sidebar, HelpSection), not by tiny primitives.
2. Don't over-split one-off markup into many micro-components that add prop-drilling without reuse value.
3. Prefer “container screen + presentational component” split for complex screens.

## Types & Contracts
1. Shared cross-screen UI contracts go to `src/types/**` (example: chat UI message, pending attachment).
2. Keep component prop types local to component files unless reused in multiple places.
3. When moving logic out of screens, preserve existing behavior and event ordering first, then optimize.

## Refactor Safety Checklist
1. Keep the Gateway event flow behavior unchanged when extracting hooks/components.
2. Preserve existing user-visible copy and interaction behavior unless explicitly requested.
3. After refactor, run `npx tsc --noEmit` and verify Chat/Config critical paths still work.

# Unit Testing Rules

The project uses Jest + ts-jest for unit testing. Tests cover utils, services, hooks, and data modules.

## Test Infrastructure
- Config: `jest.config.ts` (ts-jest, node environment)
- Setup: `jest.setup.ts` (mocks for AsyncStorage, expo-linking, expo-secure-store, expo-haptics, expo-clipboard, crypto)
- RN mock: `__mocks__/react-native.ts` (Platform, Alert, StyleSheet, etc.)
- Run: `npm test` / `npm run test:coverage`

## Post-Change Testing Requirements

After completing any task that modifies logic (not pure UI-only styling changes), you **must**:

1. **Run existing tests:** Execute `npm test` and confirm all tests pass. If any test fails due to your change, fix the test or the code — do not leave broken tests.
2. **Evaluate whether new tests are needed.** Add tests when your change:
   - Adds or modifies a pure function in `src/utils/` or `src/services/`
   - Changes event handling, parsing, formatting, or data transformation logic
   - Adds or modifies a custom hook's stateful logic in `src/hooks/`
   - Changes GatewayClient behavior (event dispatch, message extraction, state transitions)
   - Fixes a bug — add a regression test that would have caught the bug
3. **Skip new tests** when the change is purely:
   - UI layout / styling (colors, spacing, component arrangement)
   - Adding a new screen with no novel logic (just wiring existing hooks/utils)
   - Updating static data (e.g. adding an entry to a list with no new logic)

## How to Write Tests

- **File placement:** Test files go next to source — `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`
- **Structure:** Use `describe` / `it` blocks with clear English descriptions
- **Pure functions:** Test directly — import and call with various inputs, assert outputs
- **Hooks:** Use `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-native`, or mock `react` primitives if the hook is too coupled to RN
- **Services with external deps:** Mock WebSocket, AsyncStorage, expo modules — never make real network calls
- **Edge cases to cover:** null/undefined inputs, empty arrays, boundary values, error paths
- **Test names:** Describe the behavior, not the implementation (e.g. "returns empty string for null input" not "checks if input is null")

## What NOT to Test
- React component rendering / UI layout — only logic
- Third-party library internals
- Trivial pass-through functions with no branching

# Design Tokens

All structural style values (spacing, font size, border radius, shadows, animation presets) must come from `src/theme/tokens.ts`.

## Token Reference

| Category | Token | Value | Usage |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Spacing** | `Space.xs` | 4 | Tight gaps, icon margins |
| | `Space.sm` | 8 | Standard inner padding |

| | `Space.lg` | 16 | Screen padding, generous spacing |
| | `Space.xl` | 24 | Section separators, large gaps |
| | `Space.xxl` | 32 | Major section breaks |
| | `Space.xxxl` | 48 | Bottom padding for scroll content |
| **Font Size** | `FontSize.xs` | 11 | Badges, timestamps |
| | `FontSize.sm` | 12 | Captions, helper text |
| | `FontSize.md` | 13 | Descriptions, secondary text |
| | `FontSize.base` | 15 | Body text, input text, card titles |
| | `FontSize.lg` | 16 | Screen titles |
| | `FontSize.xl` | 18 | Large headings (rare) |
| | `FontSize.xxl` | 22 | Emoji icons in cards |
| **Font Weight** | `FontWeight.regular` | 400 | Body text |
| | `FontWeight.medium` | 500 | Subtle emphasis |

| | `Radius.lg` | 20 | Pill inputs, large buttons |
| | `Radius.full` | 9999 | Perfect circles |
| **Shadow** | `Shadow.sm` | — | Subtle lift (cards) |
| | `Shadow.md` | — | Floating elements (FAB, popover) |
| | `Shadow.lg` | — | Modals, overlays |

## Shared UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)

| Component | Purpose | When to use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `IconButton` | Bare icon touch target | Header actions, toolbar, inline utilities |
| `HeaderActionButton` | Header icon action button | Actions shown inside native-stack headers and `ScreenHeader.rightContent` |
| `HeaderTextAction` | Header text action | Text-only actions inside native-stack headers and `ScreenHeader.rightContent` |
| `CircleButton` | Solid circle + icon | Send, scroll-to-bottom, FAB |
| `ScreenHeader` | Top navigation bar | All Console sub-pages (not Chat — Chat has its own header) |
| `ModalScreenLayout` | Page-level modal shell | Native-stack modal/detail screens with a close-style header |
| `Card` | Rounded surface container | List items, menu items, detail sections |
| `LoadingState` | Centered spinner + message | Full-screen loading |
| `EmptyState` | Icon + title + optional action | Empty lists, no results |
| `SegmentedTabs` | iOS-style segmented tab bar | Any page with 2+ switchable views (Cron Runs/Jobs, Connections Channels/Nodes) |
| `ModalSheet` | Centered card modal with backdrop | All centered-card modals (tool detail, avatar, editor, picker) |
| `SearchInput` | Pill-shaped search field with icon | Any list/page that needs keyword filtering |

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever you create, refactor, or extract a new shared UI component into `src/components/ui/`, you **must** update this table and add corresponding usage rules to this file and `CLAUDE.md`.

## Adding New Tokens
1. Add to `src/theme/tokens.ts` with a clear semantic name.
2. Update the token reference table in this file.
3. Prefer extending existing scales (add `Space.xxxl` not `Space.mySpecialPadding`).

# Cross-Tab Navigation Rules

## Architecture
The app uses a bottom-tab navigator with nested stack navigators per tab (e.g. Console tab contains a `ConsoleStack` with `ConsoleMenu` → sub-screens).

## Required Rules
1. **Never use `CommonActions.navigate` with `params: { screen: 'SubScreen' }` to deep-link into a nested stack from another tab.** This replaces the entire stack state with only the target screen — the stack root is lost, so the back button jumps to the previous tab instead of the stack root.
2. When navigating from another tab (e.g. Office) into a nested stack screen (e.g. Console → Usage), explicitly set the stack state with the root screen at the bottom:
   ```typescript
   navigation.dispatch(
     CommonActions.navigate({
       name: 'Console',
       params: {
         state: {
           routes: [
             { name: 'ConsoleMenu' },
             { name: 'Usage' },
           ],
         },
       },
     }),
   );
   ```
3. For navigating to just the tab root (no sub-screen), `navigation.navigate('Console')` is fine.

# Office Game Sprite Pipeline

# Office Game Architecture Rules

## Runtime Layout
- Bootstrap and fixed-timestep loop live in `office-game/src/main.ts`.
- React Native remains the source of truth for OpenClaw data. `office-game/src/bridge.ts` only adapts bridge messages into office runtime state.
- Office simulation/domain logic lives in:
  - `office-game/src/world.ts`
  - `office-game/src/pathfinding.ts`
  - `office-game/src/character.ts`
  - `office-game/src/bubbles.ts`
  - `office-game/src/bubble-scheduler.ts`
- Office menu is split by responsibility:
  - `office-game/src/menu.ts` = facade/public API + input routing
  - `office-game/src/menu-state.ts` = mutable menu state only
  - `office-game/src/menu-model.ts` = derived data, filtering, labels, pagination data
  - `office-game/src/menu-layout.ts` = panel geometry and hit rectangles
  - `office-game/src/menu-draw.ts` = canvas drawing only
- Office renderer is split by responsibility:
  - `office-game/src/renderer.ts` = canvas lifecycle, global input handling, render pipeline orchestration
  - `office-game/src/renderer-scene.ts` = floor/furniture/character scene drawing
  - `office-game/src/renderer-overlays.ts` = whiteboard, badges, bubbles, sweat/startle overlays
  - `office-game/src/renderer-shared.ts` = small shared rendering helpers

## Required Refactor Rules
1. Keep `menu.ts` and `renderer.ts` as thin facades. Do not grow them back into thousand-line files.
2. Put pure derivation logic in `menu-model.ts` or other pure helper modules, not in drawing or bridge code.
3. Put mutable singleton UI state in `menu-state.ts`; avoid introducing duplicate ad-hoc module state elsewhere.
4. Put canvas drawing in draw-focused modules and keep side effects limited to rendering and stored hit bounds.
5. Extend office features by data flow order:
   - bridge/domain state
   - simulation/scheduler
   - render/model helpers
   - input/navigation wiring
6. Preserve the public API contracts used by the runtime:
   - `menu.ts` exports menu open/close/input/draw functions
   - `renderer.ts` exports `initRenderer()` and `render()`
7. Do not make `office-game` fetch OpenClaw data directly. RN must continue to own polling, gateway access, and navigation.
8. When adding new office interactions, prefer adding a new bridge/menu action mapping instead of hardcoding navigation logic inside draw modules.

## Office Feature Design Guidance
1. Treat the office as a data-driven management simulation, not a detached mini-game.
2. New “fun” behavior should be grounded in real OpenClaw state whenever possible (sessions, cron, usage, memory, connections, tools).
3. If a feature needs more data, extend the RN → WebView bridge in a backward-compatible message rather than scraping existing UI state in the renderer.
4. Prefer reusable event/scheduler primitives over one-off timers embedded in rendering code.
5. Before adding new office UI, first decide which layer owns it:
   - bridge/domain
   - simulation/scheduler
   - menu model/layout
   - renderer scene/overlay
6. After Office refactors or feature work, run:
   - `npx tsc --noEmit`
   - `npm test -- --runInBand`
   - `cd office-game && npm run build`

## Source
- Pixel art source: `office-game/scripts/sprites/` (palette, tiles, furniture, decorations, characters)
- Generator: `office-game/scripts/generate-sprites.ts`
- Output: `office-game/sprites/` (PNG sheets + `sprites.json` frame map)
- Build: `cd office-game && npx tsx scripts/generate-sprites.ts && npm run build`

## ⚠️ Sprite Registration Pitfall
`generate-sprites.ts` merges `FURNITURE` and `DECORATIONS` into a single sprite sheet. If you **rename or remove** a key that the merge logic depends on as an insertion anchor, decorations silently vanish from the sheet — `getFrame()` returns `undefined` and the entire canvas render crashes (all furniture disappears).

**Rule:** When adding/removing/renaming sprite entries in `furniture.ts` or `decorations.ts`, always verify `sprites.json` output contains ALL expected keys. Run:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-sprites.ts
# Check the "N sprites" count matches expectations
```

## Renderer Fail-Safe Rule
When introducing or changing office sprite keys, renderer code must use safe frame lookup and fallback for optional elements.

1. Use a safe lookup (`getFrameSafe` pattern with `try/catch`) instead of direct `getFrame` for optional/new sprites.
2. If a frame is missing, skip that single element or use a known fallback sprite.
3. Never allow one missing frame to abort the whole render pass.

## Furniture-Disappear Troubleshooting
If all furniture disappears after sprite work, check in this order:

1. Verify the expected key exists in `office-game/sprites/sprites.json`.
2. Regenerate sprite assets and rebuild:
```bash
cd office-game
npx tsx scripts/generate-sprites.ts
npm run build
```
3. Confirm renderer mapping and fallback paths cover the new key (especially optional decorations).

# Tab UI Rules

All tabbed page layouts must use the shared `SegmentedTabs` component (`src/components/ui/SegmentedTabs.tsx`).

## Required Rules
1. **Always use `SegmentedTabs`** for switchable tab views — never hand-roll tab bar UI.
2. Define tab items as a typed constant array outside the component:
   ```typescript
   const MY_TABS: { key: MyTab; label: string }[] = [
     { key: 'first', label: 'First' },
     { key: 'second', label: 'Second' },
   ];
   ```
3. Place `<SegmentedTabs>` directly below `<ScreenHeader>` in the page layout.
4. Each tab's content should be a separate component (not inline JSX) to keep the main screen file clean.

## Usage
```tsx
import { SegmentedTabs } from '../../components/ui';

<SegmentedTabs tabs={MY_TABS} active={tab} onSwitch={setTab} />
```

# Centered Modal Rules

All centered-card modals (confirmation dialogs, pickers, detail views, editors) must use the shared `ModalSheet` component (`src/components/ui/ModalSheet.tsx`).

## Required Rules
1. **Always use `ModalSheet`** for centered-card modals — never hand-roll `<Modal>` + backdrop + card + header.
2. Pass `title` for a standard header with title text + X close button. Omit `title` for custom header layouts.
3. Use `headerRight` for extra elements between the title and close button (e.g. duration badge, status indicator).
4. Use `maxHeight` to control card height (default `'75%'`).
5. Content goes as `children` — `ModalSheet` handles the outer shell only.

## When NOT to use ModalSheet
- Bottom-sheet modals (e.g. `ModelPickerModal`, `CommandOptionPickerModal`) that are bottom-aligned with top-rounded-only corners and `FlatList` — these have a different layout pattern.

## Usage
```tsx
import { ModalSheet } from '../../components/ui';

<ModalSheet visible={visible} onClose={onClose} title="Edit Connection" maxHeight="70%">
  <ScrollView>{/* modal content */}</ScrollView>
</ModalSheet>
```

# Modal Screen Layout Rules

All native-stack modal/detail pages that use a close-style header should use the shared `ModalScreenLayout` component (`src/components/ui/ModalScreenLayout.tsx`) unless the screen is already delegating to a reusable view with its own header API.

## Required Rules
1. **Always use `ModalScreenLayout`** for page-level modal/detail screens that need close semantics instead of back semantics.
2. Pass `onClose` and let the layout render the close affordance; do not hand-roll a separate modal-page header.
3. Use `rightContent` for lightweight title-bar actions such as save/edit/run.
4. Keep scrolling inside the screen body; `ModalScreenLayout` only owns the outer shell and header.
